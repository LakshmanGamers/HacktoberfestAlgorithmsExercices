## Hacktoberfest 🎉

During the month of October, Hacktoberfest takes place, an event to celebrate Open Source, organized by Digital Ocean and open to the entire community.

The event aims to contribute to Open Source projects, and although mostly devs contribute, it is possible to contribute in any capacity, so if you are a designer, tester, mentor, or have any other role in technology, you can participate.
